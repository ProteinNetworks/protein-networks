# protein-networks
Refactored version of the PhD code using a MongoDB backend to store the generated data, providing the Python module
"proteinnetworks".

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/wllgrnt/protein-networks.svg?token=SQysmopgMsk5Ksy6iu6f&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/wllgrnt/protein-networks)

This assumes that:

- There is a MongoDB instance in the default place
- The "Infomap" community detection is in the system path.


This repo stores the source code, any required database initialisation/configuration scripts, and the associated tests and documentation. For examples and IPython Notebooks see protein-networks-scaffolding
